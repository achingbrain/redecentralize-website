            <p class="">It took centuries for us to work out how to use print fairly. Concepts like copyright, the novel and libraries were formed, which we all take for granted now. Although it seems like lots has happened... personal computers, the world wide web, smart phones… Really, it’s only just begun. The original Internet was decentralized. Anyone could set up parts of it. That’s why it won. For various reasons, control of our information technologies is increasingly falling into a few hands. Some big companies and Governments. We want it to become decentralized. Again.</p>
